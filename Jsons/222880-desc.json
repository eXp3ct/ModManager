They've pioneered gameplay innovations and optimizations used in practically every modern mod in existence. The Forge Energy system was built from Redstone Flux, and many common modded features - side reconfiguration, advanced redstone control, blue/orange input coloring - all started with the Thermal Series.</p>\n<p>The Thermal Series is a modular series of mods, allowing players, server owners, and modpack creators to easily choose the aspects which they want and those which they do not, allowing it to fit into a variety of gameplay styles and worlds.</p>\n<p>As a set, the mods form a cohesive experience which greatly expands the Minecraft universe in a lore-friendly (but admittedly technological) way.</p>\n<p>This module contains both &quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Foundation&quot; - a collection of common components, resources, and tools.</p>\n<p>The mods are still being updated regularly and the Series is not complete yet! We're working on it and appreciate your patience. Even so, there's a LOT of stuff for both newcomers and veterans. We hope you enjoy the new Thermal Series.</p>\n<h3><strong>Configuration</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Client</em>: <code>thermal-client.toml</code> file located in <code>/config</code></li>\n<li><em>Server</em>: <code>thermal-server.toml</code> located in the <code>/saves/WORLD_NAME/serverconfigs</code> folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Copying this file to your <code>/defaultconfigs</code> folder will apply those configs to all newly created worlds.</p>\n<p>Dedicated servers will have this file in <code>/world/serverconfigs</code></p>\n<h2><strong>Features</strong></h2>\n<p>This section describes features available for the version under active development. Older versions may have different features.</p>\n<p>WIP - Thanks for your patience.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CoFH/Version/master/thermal/media/thermal_series.png\" alt=\"Thermal Series\"> </p>\n<h3><strong>The other modules are here:</strong></h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-cultivation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Cultivation</a> - Farming and Foods</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-dynamics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Dynamics</a> - Logistics and Transport</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-expansion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Expansion</a> - Machinery and Industry (The original mod)</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-innovation\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Innovation</a> - Advanced Power Tools and Gadgets</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-integration\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Integration</a> - Modded Compatibility Enhancements</strong></li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/thermal-locomotion\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thermal Locomotion</a> - Rails and Minecarts</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>This mod series requires CoFH Core.
